The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) data collection is part of a larger effort to build a research community focused on connecting cancer phenotypes to genotypes by providing clinical images matched to subjects from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 

Clinical, genetic, and pathological data resides in the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal.

While the radiological data is stored on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
